    A utility system for decorating react components.
  </Box>
</Box>

Benefit provides a `Box` component to use for composing your application. This primitive allows you to have component level CSS resets and the ability to apply utility classes (inspired by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)) to style and decorate with.

You also have the ability to customize the configuration with your own design system rules. Extend the configuration or start from scratch and add your own colors and CSS utilities.

## Getting Started

First, add `benefit` to your project along with its peer dependencies. Then, import and use a `Box` like you would render any other react component.

```bash
yarn add benefit react emotion
```

```js
import { Box } from "benefit"
```

## Quick Example

A `<p>` tag is rendered using a `Box` below and has a few utility classes added to it.

Feel free to edit the example. Try adding a class of `text-blue-700`, or `shadow`.

<Playground>
  <Box is="p" className="bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded">
    Hello, World
  </Box>
</Playground>
