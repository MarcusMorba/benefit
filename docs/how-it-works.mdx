Now that you've had a glimpse at how to get started with `benefit`, we can go more into how it works.

At it's core, `benefit` is doing a few things:

### Injecting utility styles

`benefit` scans the classes that you provide to elements/components and looks for any supported [utilities](/utilities). If any are found, the corresponding styles are injected into the document using `emotion`.

### Style reset

A default reset is applied to all `benefit` elements. This is mostly just resetting margin, padding, inheriting font sizes, etc.

```css
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
border-width: 0;
border-style: solid;
color: inherit;
font-family: inherit;
font-size: inherit;
font-weight: inherit;
text-decoration-color: currentColor;
line-height: inherit;
vertical-align: baseline;
box-sizing: border-box;
```

> These reset rules can be overridden. See the [customization](/customization) section for more info.

### Important prop

You also have the option of telling `benefit` to append `!important` to all utility and reset styles. Just provide an `important` prop to the element/component that you want to isolate.

Example:

```jsx
<div className="text-red-500 font-bold" important>
  Error
</div>
```

Which produces:

<Box className="text-red-500 font-bold" important>
  Error
</Box>

_Inspect in the console to see the important rules being applied_
