import { Box } from "../dist/benefit.js"

### Install dependencies

First, add `benefit` to your project along with its peer dependencies.

```bash
yarn add benefit react emotion
```

### Setup transpilation

Next, set the jsx pragma at the top of your source file where you intend to use `benefit`.

```js
/** @jsx jsx */
```

> Similar to a comment containing linter configuration, this configures the jsx babel plugin to use the `jsx` function instead of `React.createElement`.
>
> [JSX Pragma Documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#pragma)

Import the `jsx` function from `benefit`

```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "benefit"
```

### Use built in utility classes (or add your own)

Now, you're free to use any available utility classes to style your components
