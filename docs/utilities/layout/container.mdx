`container`

Containers provide a nice, responsive way to wrap your content. Add a `container` class to your `Box` to have its `max-width` match the `min-width` of the current breakpoint. All containers have a `width: 100%` applied.

Built-in breakpoints are defined by the `screens` value in the configuration.

<ConfigPropertyList property="screens" />

```js
<div className="mx-auto container bg-gray-200 rounded p-4">
  <h1 className="text-2xl tracking-tighter uppercase font-bold text-center">
    Business at the speed of light.
  </h1>
</div>
```

<Box className="mx-auto container bg-gray-200 rounded p-4">
  <Box
    is="h1"
    className="text-2xl tracking-tighter uppercase font-bold text-center"
  >
    Business at the speed of light.
  </Box>
</Box>

> The above `container` has a utility of `mx-auto` added so it is centered horizontally within the parent.
