# Box

A `Box` is responsible for:

- Rendering any `html` tag using the `is` prop
- Providing a lightweight CSS reset at the element level
- Adding styles for any of the available built-in utility classes (or your own provided utilities)
- Optionally marking all utility/reset styles to be `!important`

## The `is` prop

A `Box` defaults to rendering a `<div>`. Provide any valid `html` tag using the `is` prop to control what is rendered.

<Playground>
  <Box is="span">Some text</Box>
</Playground>

## CSS reset

By default, a base reset is applied to all `Box` components:

```css
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
border-width: 0;
border-style: solid;
/* This is a color derived from the default theme and can be customized */
border-color: #d4dae1;
color: inherit;
font-family: inherit;
font-size: inherit;
font-weight: inherit;
line-height: inherit;
vertical-align: baseline;
box-sizing: border-box;
```

## Adding utility classes

Provide a utility class to a `Box`, and any related styles are injected into the markup for you. Only the styles you use. Nothing extra.

<Playground>
  <Box is="span" className="text-red-600 font-bold text-3xl">
    Some text
  </Box>
</Playground>

## The `important` prop

Add the `important` prop to ensure that any resets and utilities are inlined with `!important` (Really useful for 3rd party distributed components).

<Playground>
  <Box
    is="span"
    important
    className="text-purple-600 font-bold uppercase text-4xl"
  >
    Some text
  </Box>
</Playground>
